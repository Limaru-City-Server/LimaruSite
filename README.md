# Limaru Website
This is a website project to provide Limaru with a website. Limaru has been lacking a website for the better part of its history, and attempts at making it has always resulted in a mess. Therefore, here's version 3 of that mess!

## What is Limaru?
Limaru is a city server in the video game, Minecraft. Being based around trains, it aims to have an extensive railway network spanning the entire city.

Join Limaru today using IP `play.limaru.net`! Available on both Java and Bedrock platforms.
