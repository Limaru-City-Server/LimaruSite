    <p class="hed1">It all started with an argument...</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">29th June 2019. Parliament. All MPs present. Number of online players: Nine.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">It seemed peaceful at first. However, an explosion was heard outside the parliament doors. The MP for Emmaru Constituency, Mikhail, requested for a break in Parliament to take a look. The request was rejected by the Speaker on the advice of the Supreme Leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Another explosion was heard two minutes later. Once again, Mikail decided to request for a break. It was rejected again.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Suddenly, two players broke through the parliament doors. Threatening to grief the building and the server, they requested for everyone to surrender. As an immediate measure, Mikhail requested that the two players be banned, as per the protocol at that time. The request was rejected by the Supreme Leader. Instead, a break was finally approved. But it was too late. A few chunks had been corrupted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">This was not an ordinary grief.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Over the next few days, a team decided to investigate the matter. It was concluded that the two terrorists had been given the go-ahead by the Supreme Leader to enforce the full obedience of the people. The MP Mikhail would not take this lightly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">2nd July 2019. Emmaru signs the declaration of independence, taking half of the server with it. A bedrock wall is constructed between the two sides of the server, most notably cutting through the central business district.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">4th July 2019. Another large chunk of the server, Lipan, decides to declare independence and immediately sign a merger contract with Emmaru. This is now commemorated as Revolution Day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Until now, the server had been hosted on a server computer in the Supreme Leader's house. This was when the Supreme Leader decided to delete the server files in order to stop Limaru. However, he did not realise all backups are available for download between everyone. To save the server, Mikhail decided it would be better if he hosted the server himself. The backup from 28 June had been sitting in a corner of his computer for a short while, so as a result, the backup was loaded up onto a server. This arrangement continues to this day.</p>
